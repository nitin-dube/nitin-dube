## About Me
I'm a results-driven final-year Computer Science student specializing in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, with strong hands-on experience building full‑stack web applications and ML prototypes. I enjoy turning data and models into products that people use — from real-time vision systems to responsive web portals.

Highlights:
- Built a real-time Vision Transformer emotion detector (≈85% validation accuracy, ≈89% top-2) and a Streamlit demo with webcam-powered music recommendations.
- Delivered production-minded web solutions (React, Node, WordPress) that improved performance and user experience — page load/time and portal responsiveness improvements of 20–30%.
- Launched a bilingual NGO website that boosted engagement by 35% and an attendance portal that cut faculty data entry time by ~40%.
